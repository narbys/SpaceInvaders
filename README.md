# SpaceInvaders

For my gradwork in DAE, I decided to research gameboy game development.
This project is part of my case study.

It is a Space Invaders 'clone' written in C with GBDK2020.

### Warning
Note that this is a project made to research the C+GBDK development method for Gameboy. This is code written by a beginner and could contain some bad practices so use it as an example at your own risk. It is also not a complete state of Space Invaders and rather a barebones one to focus on the implementation on certain mechanics.

# Dependencies
The .vscode file is configured with the Emulicious extension and Emulicious debugger.
It also expects your GBDK folder to be under C:/ by default.
Of course, all of these can edited in the vscode config.
